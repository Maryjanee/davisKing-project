                davisKING is a gospel singer and writer with a specific mandate
                to teach people through music as inspired by God. He was born
                into a family of three, sandwiched between a sister and a
                brother. He grew up listening to his fatherâ€™s playlist
                comprising of songs from King Sunny Ade, Panam Percy Paul,
                Michael Jackson, Smokey Robinson etc. Davis has had it coming
                musically since his early days in the choir. He has been a
                member of several bands like the Battle Axe.
